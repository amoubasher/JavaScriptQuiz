In this project, I made a simple JavaScript quiz that asks four questions. This implemented a lot of what we learned in week 4 in how to manipulate the DOM
and how to add HTML straight from the JavaScript. This took a lot more time than I anticipated and I ended up making & remaking multiple versions of this quiz.
I tried to follow a YouTube tutorial but I could not follow everything that the video was doing, as they incorporated a lot of information that we have not learned yet.
I went back and started from scratch, as one can probably tell when they open the quiz and see the simplicity of it.

I could not figure out how to randomize the correct answer, so each third option is the correct answer. Everything else works fine in the quiz. Gettting a wrong answer
will deduct time, and it will allow the user to save their score to local memory. I followed all acceptance criteria and there are no errors in the console.

I would like to improve upon what I have made, especially in the styles. After we learn a little more of bootstrap I will come back and improve it.
Overall, this was a very simple challenge but it took some time to get in the groove of things. I have attached the screenshot and link to this README.
